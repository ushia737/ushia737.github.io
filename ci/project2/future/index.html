            The future for me looks like a lot of gray. Not the gray I saw before, 
            where there was a dullness with life. </p>
          <p id="futuretext2" onclick="togglediv2('futuretext3')">
            More like a gray in the things around me. Gray all around. In the ground, in the walls, in the people.  </p>
          <p id="futuretext3" onclick="togglediv3('futuretext4')">The buildings made of that gray concrete we onced called skyscrapers will have 
              reached such heights that they no longer rise from the ground to touch the sky.
              They will intimidate us from above as there is no more room for concrete on the ground.</p>
          <p id="futuretext4" onclick="togglediv4('futuretext5')">In the future, I may long for those hills and trees that I once resented. I won't be surprised if at some point
            down the road, I begin to resent the city life I once craved. Maybe I'll even fear it, as I've seen what
            it has done to some. </p>
          <p id="futuretext5" onclick="togglediv5('futuretext6')">The people here aren't like the people from back home. There's a cold, stoic nature
            to them where they don't care about you. Their goal was also here. Everyone is so focused on their own path that most won't ever look up at yours.  </p>
          <p id="futuretext6" onclick="togglediv6('futuretext7')">I look back in some fondness of where I've come from. I've grown from my past and am a new person, but that
            hopeful color is still apart of me. A hopeful gleam that I can take the past and make a future with those 
          memories. I will create in the hopes that my own unique experiences will make me stand out amongst that gray 
          I chose to settle in so long ago.  </p>
