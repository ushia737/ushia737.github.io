          I was always looking forward to the future in the past. I idolized the potential. </p>
        <p id="pasttext2" onclick="togglediv2('pasttext3')">
          I've always been looking towards cities through my youth. There was something about how in a city, you could be anyone or do anything. There was a limitless potential.  </p>
        <p id="pasttext3" onclick="togglediv3('pasttext4')">Growing up in the suburbs, the adventurous nature of the city seemed so far away. When you're from a town where a lot of people liked to stay where they were. Stagnation seemed like the norm.</p>
        <p id="pasttext4" onclick="togglediv4('pasttext5')">I was in such a rush to move past the dulled forests and hills I once grew up that I began to resent where I had came from. I wish I was more accepting of my history and how it had shaped me. Maybe I would've had more fun in a time where there wasn't as much to worry about.</p>
        <p id="pasttext5" onclick="togglediv5('pasttext6')">While I hated my hometown, it made me who I am today. I wish I knew this a few years ago. I wish I had time to appreciate the good I saw down the road instead of focusing on what was holding me back. I wish I was aware of what I know now.</p>
